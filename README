This is my own Math package, I plan to comment it out, generate JavaDocs and add Testcases.

It should be a fast library, but it is unsafe since it never check the sizes when operating. This lib is also optimized for dense matrices.

Currently it is just a split from my common library. 

Also it is intended to be used with Java1.6, wheras my common is build for 1.7.

You can simply build with "mvn clean package install" the created jar contains debugable code + sources.
